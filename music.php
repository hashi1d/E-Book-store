                <h2> Guitar Scales Easy Music Lessons</h2>
                <p> <I> The minor pentatonic scale is used by loads of guitarists, so it's a great first scale to learn. Although it has a long name, it's easy to play. It has five different notes, with the first note repeated at a higher pitch, so you play six notes in total. The first note is where the scale gets its name.</I> </p>
