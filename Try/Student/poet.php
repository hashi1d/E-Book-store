                <h2> William Shakespeare Poems</h2>
                <p> <I> Six additional sonnets appear in his plays Romeo and Juliet, Henry V and Love's Labour's Lost. Shakespeare's sonnets generally focus on the themes of love and life. The first 126 are directed to a young man whom the speaker urges to marry, but this man then becomes the object of the speaker's desire.
